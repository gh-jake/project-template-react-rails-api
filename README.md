Phase 4 Project - React and Rails

Welcome to Beach Central, where users are able to keep track of, review, and edit the beaches they would like to visit this summer. In order to start the application, run "$npm install --prefix client "in the terminal, followed by "$rails s" and "$npm start --prefix client". 

To use the application, sign up with a unique username and create a password. After logging in, select "Beaches", where you are able to examine, add, edit, and delete beaches. Click on a beach to view details such as whether or not it is dog friendly, has a snack bar, and has restrooms. When you are finished using the app, hit CTRL + C in both terminal windows to stop the Rails app and the React server. Happy summer!
